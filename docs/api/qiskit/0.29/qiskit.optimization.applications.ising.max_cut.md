# qiskit.optimization.applications.ising.max\_cut

Convert max-cut instances into Pauli list Deal with Gset format. See [https://web.stanford.edu/\~yyye/yyye/Gset/](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/yyye/Gset/) Design the max-cut object w as a two-dimensional np.array e.g., w\[i, j] = x means that the weight of a edge between i and j is x Note that the weights are symmetric, i.e., w\[j, i] = x always holds.
